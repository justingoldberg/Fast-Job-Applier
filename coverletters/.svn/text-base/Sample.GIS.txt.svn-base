Dear <name>,

I am writing in response to the <position> position listed at <url>.

I am currently earning an MS in Computer Science and I consider myself a very good programmer.  I am attaching my resume which further details my skills and experience.  I have also always been extremely interested in geographical information systems.  For example, when I bought my first GPS device two years ago I seriously considered writing my own simple GIS application to work with it.  (I wanted something that would chart my speed over time which I couldn't find in free, existing software.)  Ever since then I've been wanting to break into the GIS field but have never been sure how to get started.  Although I don't have experience with most of the GIS technologies you listed, I am very enthusiastic about the field and am a very fast learner.  I hope you will still consider me for this position.  Even if you don't feel I am a good fit for this job, I would very much appreciate any advice on how to get myself started in the GIS field.

You can contact me to discuss this position anytime.  You can reach me at this email address or call me on my home phone at (443) 800-4700.

Thanks,

Jon Nerdo
